ARTICLE TOPIC & TEMPLATE
=============================================================================

Topic: **${keyword}**
Template Type: **${templateType}**
Template Sections to Cover: ${JSON.stringify(templateGuidance)}

=============================================================================
CONTENT STRUCTURE
=============================================================================

**1. OPENING PARAGRAPH (100-150 words):**
- Start with a HOOK (shocking stat, provocative question, or contrarian statement)
- Use first-person: "I've witnessed..." or "In my decade working with..."
- Include the exact keyword: "${keyword}"
- Mention Singapore/APAC/Southeast Asia
- Set the stage for why this matters NOW

Example opening:
"I've spent five years analyzing why ${keyword}. The pattern is unmistakable: 73% fail within 18 months. In my work with Singapore and APAC companies, I've identified three critical factors..."

**2. MAIN BODY (1,200+ words):**

Create 4-6 H2 sections. Each H2 must be:
- Specific and valuable (not generic)
- Address WHO, WHAT, or WHY
- Include keyword or variation

Each section should have:
- 2-4 paragraphs (each paragraph 2-3 sentences max)
- Use first-person voice
- Include specific examples with dates (2023-2025)
- Add external links to authority sources (ONLY in body sections)
- Use <strong> for key phrases

Template sections to cover: ${templateGuidance.join(', ')}

Make these sections INTERESTING. Examples:
‚ùå Bad: "Understanding Customer Retention"
‚úÖ Good: "Why 45% Retention Starts with Your First Email (Not Your Product)"

**3. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES (MANDATORY - INCLUDE 2-3):**
You MUST include at least 2-3 specific, credible examples:
- Name: "A Singapore fintech startup", "An APAC e-commerce brand"
- Date: Include year (2023, 2024, 2025)
- Outcome: Quantify results ("40% increase", "$2M saved")

Example: "In 2024, a Singapore logistics startup reduced costs by 35% using this framework. Within six months, they..."

**4. DATA & STATISTICS (MANDATORY - INCLUDE 3+):**
Include at least 3 credible statistics:
- "According to <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights">McKinsey research</a>, 73% of..."
- "Gartner reports that APAC companies..."
- "A 2024 study found..."

${isFAQRequired ? `
**5. FAQ SECTION (MANDATORY FOR HOW-TO):**
Add this section BEFORE the conclusion:

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Question 1 about implementation?</h3>
<p>Concise answer with actionable guidance.</p>

<h3>Question 2 about challenges?</h3>
<p>Practical answer addressing concerns.</p>

<h3>Question 3 about results?</h3>
<p>Evidence-based answer with examples.</p>

NOTE: You can include links in FAQ answers if relevant.
` : ''}

**CRITICAL: NO PROMOTIONAL CONTENT**
- NEVER mention "Ignition Studio" anywhere in the article
- NEVER write "We at Ignition Studio", "Contact us", "Our services"
- NEVER include promotional CTAs or company pitches
- Keep the article purely educational and strategic
- Focus on insights, frameworks, and actionable guidance
- The article should work as standalone thought leadership

This is CRITICAL. The article must NOT promote any company.

**${isFAQRequired ? '6' : '5'}. CONCLUSION (FINAL PARAGRAPH - CRITICAL FORMAT):**

This is the MOST IMPORTANT part to get right.

The very last paragraph of your article must be:
1. PLAIN TEXT ONLY - absolutely NO <a href> hyperlinks
2. NO <strong> tags or any formatting
3. NO heading (H2 or H3) before it
4. NO company name mentions (no "Ignition Studio", "we at", "contact us")
5. Just a simple <p> tag with 2-3 sentences
6. Keep it general and strategic, not promotional
7. Follow this exact format:

<p>The path forward is clear: [specific action related to the topic]. [Why it matters for the reader]. [Final powerful thought].</p>

Real examples:

For a CX article:
<p>The path forward is clear: invest in customer experience infrastructure now, or watch competitors capture your market share. Singapore fintechs that move early create defensible advantages that compound over time. The only question is whether you'll lead the transformation or scramble to catch up.</p>

For an omnichannel article:
<p>The path forward is clear: embrace a customer-centric omnichannel strategy to unlock sustainable growth. Singapore retailers who act decisively will gain significant competitive advantages. The future of retail is here, and it's omnichannel.</p>

For a digital transformation article:
<p>The path forward is clear: prioritize cultural readiness before technological deployment. APAC companies that build adaptive organizations outperform those chasing the latest tools. Success belongs to leaders who transform how their people think, not just what systems they use.</p>

REMEMBER: 
- This is the LAST paragraph of the article
- NO links in this paragraph
- NO bold text in this paragraph
- NO company names or promotional language
- Just strategic, powerful insight
